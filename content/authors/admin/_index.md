Hello, I am Yang(Jan) Xiao(Shaw), a software engineer and a growing AI scientist. My Life motto is: Get everything, you have to pay all,conquer all things.

Gifted in programming, I was admitted by a top-notched middle school in Anqing City. Discovering problems, searching for solutions, picking the best solution, and solving problems in an efficient way, I developed strong logic and methods in problem solving. 

Proceeding with such logic and method, in the second year of high school, I began to predict undergraduate university that I can reach by comparing my grades and ranking with those collected data from previous students. As my grades improved, I updated my references so as to make more progress to reach better universities. Seeing my progress at such a glance, I will always maintain a positive learning attitude. 

Since then, I have fallen in love with building models in computer, solving problems, and then optimizing my choices. With such fantasy, I resolutely choose a major relevant to computer science at Jilin University. 

Now, the wave of artificial intelligence is here.AI is an industry that creates miracles，I want to try my best to lead the trend and be the leader of the times.IBM,Apple,FaceBook, maybe I can be the next one.It’s interesting, isn’t it?

This is why I fall in love with CS.
